                    Fluxus Ministerija, Lithuania
                  </h3>
                <p>We once played a show in Lithuania in a space called called Fluxus Ministerija. It was an old shoe factory and felt like a squat party, but with about 10,000 people, loads of weird art installations and AV projections. You would walk through one entire section of the building, about the size of Fabric in London, then arrive in a massive hall with totally different music and people. It went on until about 5pm the following day. There were loads of crazy installations and sculptures, and a massive staircase that led to a tower, where some kind of poetry seance was going on. It didn’t have the sinister feeling you sometimes get at squat parties in the UK.</p>
             <p>The idea was to create a space or event that celebrated the Fluxus art movement: founding artist Jurgis Mačiūnas was Lithuanian. After our soundcheck we met one of the stage crew, who told us that Lithuania was full of these sort of spaces, but that hardly any of them are used. I would love to go there again.</p>

                    OHM, Berlin
                  </h3>
                <p>In the battery room of a derelict power plant, OHM (previously known as Shift) has broken free from the wing of its older brother Tresor (next door) and is fast becoming one of Berlin’s most worthy off-grid spaces. With its minimal white-tiled decor and powerful sound system, the experimental part-gallery-part-nightclub makes impressive use of its modest space. And all with admission and bar prices you’d forgotten once existed.</p>

                    3Berghain Panorama Bar, Berlin
                  </h3>
                <p>It’s a super obvious one but I’d have to say Panorama in Berlin. For me it’s still one of the best clubs in the world for DJs. They don’t allow phones into the club – which makes the experience all the more special – and the club has a great door policy. The sound is amazing in there and there’s always a very patient mixed crowd who go all night. I love it specifically because it’s treated with such reverence by all – you can’t play the bullshit there. When I play there I commit so far in advance to preparation in order to deliver something special. If every club in the world was like Panorama, it would be beautiful and simple. Berlin has changed over the past few years but it still retains that brilliant vibe that very few others have managed to replicate.</p>

                    Auslage, Vienna
                  </h3>
                <p>Auslage keeps things simple: cheap door price, decent drinks, a meaty system, room for 300 people and consistent quality lineups. And like all the best clubs, it’s dark, loud and built for dancing. It has just opened a second floor so now there is one room for house and another for techno. Although the club books serious underground artists from around Europe, the night to keep coming back for is Window Shopping, a monthly party run by Funkroom, a local Viennese collective of DJs and producers who know what they’re doing.</p>

                    Cross Club, Prague
                  </h3>
                <p>Cross Club is amazing, unique and rather strange. It’s near the centre of Prague and you would hardly believe such a place existed. Created by František Chmelík and his friends, the design and decoration has a clear steampunk influence; with an incredible layout of waste metal, wood and even ceramic, recycled for the occasion. The main room and the beautiful wall light behind the DJ booth make the club even more fantastic. The sound is great, the audience actually know how to dance and the events are all quality.</p>
