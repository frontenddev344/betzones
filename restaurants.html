                  </h3>
                <p>These days, Copenhagen is overrun by Japanese and Korean eateries that combine the cuisine of East Asia with New Nordic philosophy. 2018 saw the opening of Jah Izakaya, a casual, lively, and welcoming gastropub with Japanese influences on a street close to the meatpacking area. It has amazing beef cars, gyoza, tonkatsu, and Danish squid.</p>

                 </h3>
                 <p>
                    Suggested to me by a friend from Denmark, this light-filled location perched on a cliff overlooking the Baltic was once a traditional family-run eatery, but the proprietors of the Sticks'n'Sushi business transformed it into a more sophisticated dining experience. It's in an unexplored but rapidly developing area around 90 minutes south of Copenhagen. A picnic of Danish oysters, locally caught scallops, fish, and kimchi under the beech trees is a great way to round off a morning spent on the surrounding beaches littered with fossils.

                  <h3>
                    La Lanterna di Diogene, near Modena, Emilia Romagna
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    This restaurant and working farm in the town of Solara, named for a Cynic philosopher, takes the concept of locavore extremely seriously. Pork ribs originate from the historic breed of pigs they cultivate, the pickled vegetables are grown feet from the table, and the flour for the tortellini in brodo is milled nearby. Here, following centuries-old methods, even the balsamic vinegar poured over frittatas and ricotta flans is prepared. When visiting neighboring Modena, I usually make a stop for La Lanterna and make sure I'm not the designated driver so I can savor the exhaustive variety of dry lambruscos, which are also created in the area.

                  <p>
                    Lille The term "estaminet" refers to a specific type of restaurant found in northern France that originated from the days when coal workers would get together for beer and small talk after work. The estaminets are still there, and Au Vieux de la Vieille is among the best in Lille, even if the mines are long gone. It serves traditional delicacies including potjevleesch (four meats in aspic jelly, which tastes better than it sounds), beef carbonnade (made with beer and gingerbread), and dishes prepared with maroilles, the pungent local cheese. With its racks of trinkets, rustic wooden tables and chairs, and dried hops, the atmosphere adds just as much character to the experience as the cuisine. Reservations are required.

                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Get in there first because I think this airy, light-filled restaurant in Lisbon's Chiado area will soon receive a Michelin star. Chef António Galapito, a brilliant but extremely reserved individual who worked with Nuno Mendes in London, has returned to Portugal and his food has reached new heights. While all the product is prepared with a profound competence and punky sense, it is everything as local as possible. Every time I visit Lisbon, I return and devour everything on the menu.

                  <p>
                    Rectsins Lucifernum has been named the greatest bar in Europe for 2023! An idea that is completely macabre, absurd, and unorthodox; a place to enjoy a drink and share a life experience; a labor of passion. At the modest-looking, ominous entrance, you will find a house brimming with gothic art, antiques, and memorabilia. Dracula's Butler, with his blond hair, beckons you inside. A garden terrace and underground bar are accessible from the mansion. That's only the very beginning. This Belgian oddity can never be deemed showy because it is too unique and labor-intensive. Crazy games, great beverages, and mingling with other guests in a cozy, tiny space with no more than 20 people in attendance at once.

                  <p>
                    Szimpla Kert has written a great deal about it previously; in fact, everyone who even somewhat follows the European bar scene is likely familiar with the idea of a "ruin bar," if not with the knowledge that Szimpla Kert's ingenuity and pioneering were responsible for the development of the scene
                  </p>
                  <p>The mood and decor of Szimpla are so different from anything you've probably ever experienced that your first visit seems almost like you're walking through a doorway into a different realm. Although there are some parallels and the space is big enough to be considered a club, it seems much more laid back than that. Yes, they open in the afternoon, when the atmosphere is languid and bohemian, with people lounging around in kind of a squatter's ruin, albeit one that has been adorned.</p>

                    Zlatna Ribica, Sarajevo
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    With its abundance of antiques and eye-catching details, Zlatna Ribica (Gold Fish) is a site of exotic quirkiness. You may spend hours admiring its characteristics. Its sheer volume fills the whole space within the pub and even spills outside, where one of their quirky furniture pieces and devices is located on the pavement. Indeed, you will discover some golden fish, bowls atop heaps of books, elaborate vintage lampshades, and rails and sideboards coated in wax that are adorned with intricate details and crenulations. Though just decorative, the bar is really bizarre, with things placed in unexpected places and the strangest stuff popping up. The portable black-and-white TV that is perched on a toilet roll in the restrooms shouldn't worry you.</p>

Papa Joe’s Jazz Lokal, Cologne
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    One of the best jazz bars in the world—warm, lively, and intelligent. Roman ruins behind glass at the entryway, animated heads on the wall, and a stage similar to a theater across from the bar. A computerized reader at the front displays the entire amount, along with a live performance every night and a cocktail maker. Luxuriously decadent, whimsical, and sensual in a manner that is exclusive to Germany. It is just too at ease in its own shoes to give a damn about whether it is trendy or not. It's impossible to stay out of the activity.</p>
